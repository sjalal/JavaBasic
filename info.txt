Java Controlflow Statements:

The statements inside our source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. 
Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, 
and branching, enabling our program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code. 

This section describes the different controlflow statements supported by the Java programming language.
 
1. Decision-making statements (if-then, if-then-else, switch), 
2. Looping statements (for, while, do-while), and 
3. Branching statements (break, continue, return)
