Java Basic: ->> Java Controlflow Statements:

The statements inside our source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. 
Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, 
and branching, enabling our program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code. 

This section describes the different controlflow statements supported by the Java programming language.
 
1. Decision-making statements (if-then, if-then-else, switch), 
2. Looping statements (for, while, do-while), and 
3. Branching statements (break, continue, return) 

The if-then and if-then-else Statements:

i) The if-then Statement 
- The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. 
- It tells our program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true.

ii) The if-then-else Statement
- The if-then-else statement provides a secondary path of execution when an "if" clause evaluates to false.
